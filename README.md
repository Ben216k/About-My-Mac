#  About My Mac

A cooler recreation of the About *This* Mac screen from pre-Ventura macOS, modified from the screen originally found in Patched Sur. 

Yep... that's it. I plan on giving it more capabilities similar to the original, but for now it's just the quick information with a nice animated gradient. (Yes this has been in the text for years. It's okay, this is not a high priority project.)

Supports: macOS 11 Big Sur through macOS 26 Tahoe.
Has 22 different styles (split between OS versions unevenly).

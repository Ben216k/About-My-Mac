#  About My Mac

A cooler recreation of the About *This* Mac screen from pre-Ventura macOS, modified from the screen in Patched Sur. 

Yep... that's it. I plan on giving it more capabilities similar to the original, but for now it's just the quick information with a nice animated gradient. 

Supports: Big Sur, Monterey and Ventura.
Has 14 different styles (3 per each, plus one extra for Big Sur and Sonoma).
